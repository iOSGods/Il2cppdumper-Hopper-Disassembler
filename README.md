**Usage**
Use il2cppdumper online to dump your Unity app. https://armconverter.com/il2cppdumper/

You can drag and drop the Decrypted App Store IPA link into il2cppdumper online. https://iosgods.com/topic/156728-online-decrypted-ios-ipa-store-easily-download-cracked-ios-ipas/#comment-5051990

Download the resulting il2cppdumper archive and extract it so the script.json is available. Next open Hopper Disassembler with your executable loaded and go to Scripts > Open Script Editor... > + > Add the Python script & Run.

Next you simply select the script.json from the il2cppdumper online archive you downloaded when asked. 

That's it!
